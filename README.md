# Power BI Project: Unveiling Insights in the Movie Industry Dashboard
## Description
As a data analyst at BigScreen Insights, We have tasked with unlocking valuable insights from two extensive datasets: 'Movie Production Details' and 'Movie Revenue and Ratings'. These datasets provide comprehensive information on movie production, financial performance, and audience reception. Key columns include production companies, budgets, genres, box office revenue,location, ratings, and more. This analysis will play a crucial role in shaping strategies for movie production and marketing, impacting both BigScreen Insights and its clients in the movie industry.
## Objective
Our objective is to leverage Power BI to transform these datasets into a compelling narrative. This involves thorough data cleaning, sophisticated data modeling, and advanced analytical insights using DAX. Our ultimate goal is to create an interactive dashboard that visually presents key findings, offering actionable insights into trends, financial viability, and audience preferences within the movie industry.
## Features
- Interactive dashboard with visualizations of box office performance, genre popularity, and regional trends.
- Analysis of movie revenue, budget, and profitability metrics over time.
- Identification of top-grossing movies, genres, and production companies.
- Comparison of movie performance across different regions and demographics.
